Hi there! 
Iâ€™m Wandile, a self-taught full-stack developer based in South Africa.

I love turning design ideas into lightning-fast, accessible interfaces that feel effortless.

Outside of code, youâ€™ll find me watching anime, hitting the gym, and spending time with family and friends.

Fun Facts:
   â€¢ Hate CoffeeðŸ¤®.
   â€¢ Demon Slayer is my favorite anime.
